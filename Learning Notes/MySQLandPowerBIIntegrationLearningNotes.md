MySQL and Power BI Integration: Learning Notes

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. Connecting MySQL Database into Power BI
- The connection process between MySQL and Power BI is straightforward. Analysis workflow mirrors that of CSV or Excel data sources
- Authentication credentials connect MySQL Workbench with Power BI


### 2. Parameterized Queries for Pre-filtering
- Parameterized queries act as conditional filters before data loads into Power BI
-  Pre-filtering happens at the database level before storage in Power BI. Useful for scenarios:
	- **Data Privacy:** Parameterized queries ensure users only see data they're authorized to access, protecting sensitive information. For example, sales representatives can be limited to viewing only their assigned territories or products, preventing exposure of other customer data.
	- **Memory Consumption:** By filtering data at the database level before loading into Power BI, the amount of data processed and stored in memory is significantly reduced. This leads to faster report performance, shorter refresh times, and lower resource usage, especially important when working with large datasets.

### 3. Displaying Parameter Values in Report Titles
- Parameter values can be incorporated into report titles dynamically
- This provides immediate context for the filtered data being displayed
